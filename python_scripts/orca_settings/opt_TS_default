# These settings are appropriate for organics, organometallics, cations, and neutral molecules.
# Take note of the use of RIJCOSX and autoaux - these keywords effectively change the level of theory.
# Because TS calculations are more tricky, the QM hessian is calculated and recalculated every 20 steps
