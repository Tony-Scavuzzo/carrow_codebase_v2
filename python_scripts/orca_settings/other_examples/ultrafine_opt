# Settings for removing a negative frequency from an optimization
# These settings use a quantum mechanical hessian and tight optimization criteria to better find the minimum
# These settings also use a finer integration grid and a finer COSX grid, which arguably change the level of theory
# These settings should be used as a last resort, and if used, the entire project should be reevaluated.
